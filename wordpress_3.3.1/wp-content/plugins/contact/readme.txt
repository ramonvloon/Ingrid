Adds the ability to easily enter and display contact information.

== Description ==

Adds the ability to enter contact information and output the details in your posts, pages or templates.

Use the shortcode `[contact type="phone"]` to display any of the contact details, or use the function call `<?php if (function_exists('contact_detail')) { contact_detail('phone'); } ?>`.

Once you have defined a contact email address, use the shortcode `[contact type="form"]` to output the contact form.

== Installation ==

Here we go:

1. Upload the `contact` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enter you contact details on the options page `Settings > Contact Details`.
4. Display the details using either the shortcodes or function calls.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit my contact details? =

Navigate to the settings page by clicking on `Settings` on the left hand menu, and then the `Contact Details` option.

= How do I include details in my template? =

You can use the following function call to output details in your templates:

<?php if (function_exists('contact_detail')) { contact_detail('fax'); } ?>

= What contact details can I store? =

Current available contact fields are: `phone`, `fax`, `mobile`, `email` and `address`.

= How do you fetch contact details without outputting the value? =

The fourth parameter passed to `contact_detail()` determines whether the value is returned, by setting the value to false.

`$phone = contact_detail('phone', '<b>', '</b>', false);`

The above code will fetch the phone number stored and wrap the response in bold tags.

= How can I customise the contact form? =

If you require more customisation that cannot be achieved using CSS, you can define your own template file.

To do this add the the attribute `include` to the shortcode tag, e.g. `[contact type="form" include="myfile.php"]`.

This file should be placed within your theme directory and should include the processing and output of errors.

I suggest you use the `contact.php` file used by the plugin as a starting point / template.
